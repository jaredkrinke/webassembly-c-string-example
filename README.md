# webassembly-c-string-example
This is an example of passing strings into and out of a WebAssembly module written C, using WASI libc and Clang/LLVM.

Note: To run the build script (in `package.json`), you need to download the [WASI SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) (which includes Clang/LLVm) and extract it to a subdirectory named "wasi-sdk".
